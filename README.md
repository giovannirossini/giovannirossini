👋🏽 Hi, I am Giovanni - a senior DevOps engineer, passionate about learning, creating, and automating.

I have been working as a DevOps engineer since 2017, and since that, I've been paid to solve problems using Linux and containers.

🖥️ I'm currently working at BFA Industries.

🇪🇸 I’m currently learning Spanish, broadening my horizons, and enhancing my ability to connect with diverse person.

🤔 We can engage in thought-provoking conversations about Linux, DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, automation, and other related topics. I bring expertise and experience to the table, fostering knowledge exchange and mutual growth.

✏️ In my free time, I indulge in drawing, which serves as a creative outlet and a means of relaxation. It fuels my imagination and allows me to recharge.

In addition to my work at BFA Industries, I provide professional consultancy services. Through these engagements, I bring my expertise to diverse projects and collaborate closely with clients to achieve their goals.
